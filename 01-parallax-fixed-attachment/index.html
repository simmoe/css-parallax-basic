Even the light from one candle can be sufficient for handheld photography. As the worldâ€™s highest-speed aspherical lens, the Noctilux-M 50 mm f/0.95 ASPH. exceeds the perception of the human eye. State-of-the-art optics and mechanical technologies have created a noticeable increase in lens speed, and a floating element retains high image quality even in the close-up range. Vignetting and distortion are even better than former Noctilux generations.</p></div>
