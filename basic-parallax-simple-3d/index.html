                <h2>The magic mountain</h2>

                <p>From Hamburg to Davos is a long journey — too long, indeed,for so brief a stay. It crosses all

                    of country; goes up hill and down dale, descends from the plateau of Southern Germany to the
                    shore
                    of Lake Constance, over its bounding waves and on across marshes once thought to be bottomless.
